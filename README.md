# SlamBot

Yeah, so, this is just a docker bot that, assuming you have set the proper environment variables, will tweet any time a news story contains the word "slams".

Basically, it happens far too often.

## Motivation

See above.  Also, wanted to try out CoreRT.

## Build

```bash
docker build . -t yourtag
```

## Test

Normally, yes.  In this case...why?
